## Currently working on  

- ‚ùî Quiz Android app developed using Flutter as the mobile framework, Django as REST API, and Postgresql for data storage. We use Heroku to host the project. However, it has yet to be released live as it is a work in progress.

## Github IO Projects

Here I have highlighted some side projects that have a visualization aspect, which makes them perfect to host on Github IO.
Note: none of these projects are developed for mobile.

### üïπÔ∏è [Cat Invaders 2](https://tkafoe.github.io/CatInvaders2)

A fun and simple, intuitive survival-type video game. You can move the player using the arrow-keys. Try to eat the yellow square to gain speed and do not let the red squares touch you. Try to survive as long as you can. This game was built in JavaScript using P5 for JavaScript as the rendering engine. I ported this game to mobile using
Cordova to add mobile input, but it is also live on my Github.io page [here](https://tkafoe.github.io/CatInvaders2).

### üîç [Sorting visualizer](https://tkafoe.github.io/SortingVisualiser)

A small animation that visualizes how the Insertion sort and Merge sort algorithms work. It uses P5 for JavaScript as a rendering engine, and you can see it on my Github IO page [here](https://tkafoe.github.io/SortingVisualiser).

---

### üé± [Bouncy Balls](https://tkafoe.github.io/BouncyBalls/)

A small animation that shows multiple balls bouncing and interacting with each other. It uses the JavaScript library Paper.js to draw and animate the balls. You can see it live on my Github IO Page [here](https://tkafoe.github.io/BouncyBalls/).
